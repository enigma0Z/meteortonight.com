Signal flow goes top down.  Tap or click on the image for a bigger view.

The guitar is an Epiphone Les Paul Trad Pro from like fifteen years ago, and
this is from the bridge pickup.  I think single coils from like a Stratocaster
or Mustang (I'm not sure what is on the original album) may sound a tad better
but this is what I have.  It still sounds pretty close to me IMO.

This goes into the Gainia TD, which is preamp effect from Kuassa that's designed
to emulate a TubeDriver pedal.  This is set to the "Almost Clean Matchlock"
preset with the gain rolled back a bit and the level brought up to compensate.
It adds just the tiniest bit of hair to an otherwise clean signal.

From there, it goes into the Kuassa Matchlock amp sim.  This sim is meant to
sound like a Fender amp, and we're using the "Clean A" preset for the starting
point.  I just bumped the level up a bit from the preset, everything else was
left the same.

You can get both of these plugins for Reason Studio (My DAW of choice), as a
VST, or in Kuassa's Amplifikation 360.  I'm not sponsored, btw (though, Kuassa,
hit me up if you wanna set something up!!), just really love Kuassa's amp sims.

Out of the amp, it goes into Quartet, a chorus plugin from Reason Studios.
Quartet is set to BBD (Bucket Brigade Delay) mode, which is similar to the Small
Clone that was used on this song.  The settings are _almost_ default, but I
turned down the mod rate just a tad and tweaked the delay until the resonance
felt right with my guitar.
