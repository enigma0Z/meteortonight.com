The guitar is an Epiphone Les Paul Trad Pro from like fifteen years ago, and
this is from the bridge pickup.  I think single coils from like a Stratocaster
or Mustang (I'm not sure what is on the original album) may sound a tad better
but this is what I have.  It still sounds pretty close to me IMO.

I used the "Almost Clean Matchlock" and "Clean A" presets from Kuassa's
incredible amp sims.  You can get these plugins for Reason Studio (My DAW of
choice) or as a VST, or in Kuassa's Amplifikation 360.  Not sponsored, btw,
just really love Kuassa's amp sims.

This is run into a BBD (Bucket Brigade Delay) style chorus, which is similar to
the Small Clone that Cobain used on this song.  The settings are _almost_
default, but I turned down the mod rate just a tad and tweaked the delay until
the resonance felt right with my guitar, YMMV.
