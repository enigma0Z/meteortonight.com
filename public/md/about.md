Hi, I'm enigma, and this is Meteor Tonight.

I've been playing piano since I was in my early teens, and guitar since I was in
my late teens.  I'm self-taught with everything except piano, for which I had
lessons when I was quite young. 

I hope you are able to find some inspiration, joy, or meaning in my music.

## FAQ

### What software do you use?

I use [Reason](https://www.reasonstudios.com/) primarily both for my DAW and for
its many soft synths.  For routing audio live (i.e. during streams, etc.) I
sometimes also use [Audio Hijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/).

For streaming I use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

### What hardware do you use?

I've got a piano-weighted Casio keyboard that feels really nice for playing
piano specifically.  This one usually is just a controller though, the sounds
are okay for practicing, Reasons' sounds generaly better.

I've also got few pieces of Roland gear as well:

* AX-Edge (The keytar you see in my [TikToks](https://www.tiktok.com/@meteor.tonight))
* VR-Combo 09 (A more regular keyboard)

I've got some others cooking as well, but I'm still working through how to be
productive with them.

### What about your guitars?

I've got four guitars I use for the most part

* Epiphone Les Paul
* Fender Telecaster
* Gretsch 5240
* Shecter Diamond Custom 5 Bass

For guitar sounds and amps, I can't sing [Kuassa](https://www.kuassa.com/)'s
praises enough.  Their amp sms are top notch and all sound great.  I use the
Lancaster (Vox style) and Rectifor (Mesa/Boogie style) amps myself, plus their
Bass driver (a take on Tech 21's Bass Driver DI) and their Cerberus bass amp.

Beyond those, I occasionally use the Softube amps packaged with Reason, though
I've found a lot more success with Kuassa's amp sims.
