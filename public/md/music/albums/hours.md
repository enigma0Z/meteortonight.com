# Hours (album)

{meta:title:Hours}

The tracks on this album represent the hours of the day.  Yes I realize that's a
bit of a "well, duh" statement, but hear me out.  Rather than being simply about
the passage of time, it's more about the feeling, or vibe each hour offers.  I
picked the given times out because it's either a keystone portion of the day for
me, or it's separated enough from the other times that by the time it reaches
that time (for instance, 6am to 9am), the day's flow has changed.

As each track is written, it'll be available as a single (see below), and once
all the tracks are done, the whole thing will be re-released as a cohesive
album.

Each track has its own liner notes, which you can see below, as well is its own
representative artwork.
